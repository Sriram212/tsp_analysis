# tsp_analysis
My implementation of the nearest neighbor, genetic, Lin-Kernighan, and Christofides algorithms to solve the TSP on real-world datasets. Code for nearest neighbor was adapted from https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/jupyter.cs/FLAIRS-2015/TSPv3.ipynb. Code for genetic was adapted from https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-implement-a-traveling-salesman-problem-genetic-algorithm-in-python-ea32c7bef20f. Python lin-kernighan package was used for Lin-Kernighan algorithm, https://pypi.org/project/lk-heuristic/. Code for Christofides algorithm was adapted from https://github.com/Retsediv/ChristofidesAlgorithm/blob/master/christofides.py. 

Datasets were taken from https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html.
